# Learning Notes




## Introduction

This repository contains my personal notes on learning JavaScript, based on the
concepts and exercises provided
by [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info). It covers
foundational JavaScript concepts, syntax, and techniques, along with hands-on
examples to reinforce learning. This is a work-in-progress as I explore new
topics and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.

## Function Basics

This is how we pass default values to a function in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Prints a greeting message with the provided name.
 *
 * @param {string} [name='Anonymous'] - The name to include in the greeting
 * message.
 */
function printName(name = `Anonymous`) {
  printOutput(`<p>Hello, ${name}!</p>`);
}

// Test the printName function.
printName(`John Lennon`); // Prints the passed value "John Lennon".
printName(); // Prints the default value "Anonymus".
```

## Ninja Code

[This](https://javascript.info/ninja-code) is a *really* good documentation.
Every single coders on Earth should read a doc like this.




## Object References and Copying

And I misunderstood [this](https://javascript.info/object-copy) for a long time!
Objects are copied by reference, so they say:

```javascript
let user = {name: 'John'};

let admin = user;

admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference

alert(user.name); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```

Sure, and I thought this would be work too:

```javascript
let user = {name: 'John'};

let admin = user;

admin = {name: 'Pete'}; // initialized a whole new object

alert(user.name); // I thought this would be 'Pete'!
```

But as I see, this is not how references work! When a whole new object is
initialized, the reference is essentially changed, so that does not impact the
`user` object here.




## Numbers

### Rough Notes

* `let billion = 1_000_000_000`: A sweet way to write large numbers. JS just
  ignores the underscores inside a number.
* And of course, the sweeter way `let billion = 1e9` exists too!
* Knew, but still, `trunc` and `floor` is not the same—to be exact—in case of
  negative numbers.

### How Detect Whether the Input Is a Number?

[This](https://javascript.info/number#repeat-until-the-input-is-a-number)
and [this](https://javascript.info/array#sum-input-numbers) made me think, a
lot. Was way harder than one would assume.

Spent a whole evening behind this, did some research,
finally [answered in Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68821383/6606776).




## Strings

As I understand, single and double quote string in JS exists only for historical
reasons. Backticks have more advantages, and I think I'm going to use backticks
from now on.

## Arrays

### `for..of` vs. `for..in`

`for..of` is specially optimized for arrays, where `for..in` is optimized for
general objects. Because of this, the second one is 10-100 times slower
according to [this](https://javascript.info/array#loops) source.

Also, as that source notes, `for..in` has another specific problem too.

### Others

So [this](https://javascript.info/array#a-word-about-length) says, the simplest
way to clear the array is: `arr.length = 0`. This may become helpful in certain
cases.




## Array Methods

### Types of Methods

Summary of this section will be useful, perhaps. There is a "cheat sheet" which
separated the methods into following types:

1. To add or remove elements
2. To search among elements
3. To iterate over elements
4. To transform the array
5. And an additional one

Now I think, I can distinguish between them. `filter` is really used to filter
out some elements in an array, and `map` really maps every element.

Of course, I can use `for` loop in any of these cases. But as I learn from this
book—the functions are *fine-tuned* to do their specific jobs, and thus much
faster.

### To Shuffle an Array

[This](https://javascript.info/array-methods#shuffle-an-array) problem, at
first, looked very trivial. Solved it using `array.sort()`, and got very
pleased—how amazingly the sort function can be used to shuffle!

And then got a slap on my face. Woah—this just doesn't work! According to the
above reference:
> Why it doesn’t work? Generally speaking, `sort` is a “black box”: we throw an
> array and a comparison function into it and expect the array to be sorted. But
> due to the utter randomness of the comparison the black box goes mad, and how
> exactly it goes mad depends on the concrete implementation that differs
> between engines.

This made sense too. `sort` was tuned for sorting, not doing the complete
opposite! And then I came to know
about [Fisher-Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)
algorithm. Very simple, yet very effective.

I love good algorithms.

My mind is blowing out.




## Map and Set

As they quote:
> The alternative to `Set` could be an array of users, and the code to check for
> duplicates on every insertion using arr.find. But the performance would be
> much worse, because this method walks through the whole array checking every
> element. `Set` is much better optimized internally for uniqueness checks.

## Date and Time

### Not `getYear()`, But `getFullYear()`

As they explain:
> Many JavaScript engines implement a non-standard method `getYear()`. This
> method is deprecated. It returns 2-digit year sometimes. Please never use it.
> There is `getFullYear()` for the year.

### Others

`Date.now()` gives the current time in milliseconds, *without* creating an
intermediate `Date` object—thus giving a better performance.

## Recursion

Now I know, I knew nothing about recursion. A simple-looking recursion takes
ages more than its loop counterpart. Why do we implement recursion in the first
place anyway?

An [interesting case](https://javascript.info/recursion#output-a-single-linked-list-in-the-reverse-order),
where the loop version essentially does the same job as recursion.

## Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax

1. The `...` in JavaScript means either rest parameters or spread syntax.
2. Spread syntax is really useful while copying an object like
   `let objNew = { ...objOld };`

## Variable Scope, Closure

### Surprise Optimizations of V8, and Debugging

Here's some beauty, again. I knew a bit about lexical environments due to our
damned Compiler course. Now I came to know, how V8 engine optimizes these
environments. That is, they analyze variable usage and if an outer variable is
not used—it is removed.

And that causes surprises in debug mode, so much so that the authors say, if we
are debugging Chrome/Edge/Opera, sooner or later we will meet this. :3

### Dead Zones

Programming languages never fail to surprise. Like the following snippet:

```javascript
let x = 1;

function func() {
  console.log(x); // What will be printed?

  let x = 2;
}

func();
```

No, it's not 1.

And no, it's not 2 either. It's en error!

Why? Here comes the concept of `<uninitialized>` variables. When an execution
block starts, it 'knows' about all the variables, and they are marked as
`<uninitialized>`. It looks like this:

```javascript
// 1. Start of lexical environment. Variable `str` is known and marked as `<uninitialized>`.

let str; // 2. Now the variable is marked as `undefined`.

str = `Lennon`; // 3. And now this has a value.
```

This is the reason why the first code snippet ends up with an error. In the
newly created lexical environment, `x` is `<uninitialized>`, and printing that
would not work.

Corresponding Task: https://javascript.info/closure#is-variable-visible

### Another Weird Behaviour of JavaScript

[This](https://javascript.info/closure#sort-by-field) problem initially looked
simple, with an immediate solution like this:

```javascript
let users = [
  {name: 'John', age: 20, surname: 'Johnson'},
  {name: 'Pete', age: 18, surname: 'Peterson'},
  {name: 'Ann', age: 19, surname: 'Hathaway'},
];

function byField(fieldName) {
  return (a, b) => a[fieldName] > b[fieldName] ? 1 : -1;
}
```

This *is* the correct solution, but the problem was with checking. I tried it
like this:

```javascript
users.sort(byField('name'));
console.log(users);
users.sort(byField('age'));
console.log(users);
```

And surprisingly, both the console logs are printed being sorted by age.

If I swap the sorts:

```javascript
users.sort(byField('age'));
console.log(users);
users.sort(byField('name'));
console.log(users);
```

Then both the logs are printed being sorted by name. It seems like the last sort
is *the* sort—which doesn't make sense.

So I tried to add a debugger:

```javascript
users.sort(byField('name'));
console.log(users);
debugger;
users.sort(byField('age'));
console.log(users);
```

When the program halts at `debugger`, `users` is printed being sorted by name,
and when resumed, the next print is sorted by age.

**I could not figure out yet why and how this happens.**




## The Old `var`

Source: https://javascript.info/var

1. `var` has no block-scope—that's pretty interesting. A simple `i` in for loop
   is visible outside the loop.<br>This. Is. Ugly.
2. A `var` with same name can be declared twice. That's also ugly.
3. All the `var` declarations are hoisted to the top. Not so much ugly—but who
   on Earth codes like this?

## Function object, NFE

### On Overriding `toString` of a function

[This](https://javascript.info/function-object#sum-with-an-arbitrary-amount-of-brackets)
task made me think a lot. Came up with a non-pretty solution, then adapted the
authors' one.

But now there seems to be a problem with overriding the `toString` method of a
function. Say, we do it like this:

```javascript
function testFunc() {
  return 0;
}

testFunc.toString = function() {
  return `A string!`;
};
```

Then the `alert` and `console.log` functions behaves very differently:

```javascript
alert(testFunc); // Prints `A string!`
console.log(testFunc); // Prints the whole function. 😒
console.log(`${testFunc}`); // Prints `A string!`
```

I can indeed wrap the function inside a `` `${}` ``, but that's not the neat
way.

Still couldn't figure out how to deal with this.




## Scheduling Functions

Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` references to the outer lexical
environment—that's expected.

But as they are scheduled, their outer variables do not get garbage collected,
until,

1. `setTimeout` is called by the scheduler.<br>Expected. Why would the outer
   variables be garbage collected if that `setTimeout` is not executed!
2. An `clearInterval` is called for `setInterval`.<br>Also expected. If
   `clearInterval` is not called, `setInterval` will run indefinitely, and the
   outer lexical environment should also remain for an indefinite time.

## Decorators and Forwarding, Call/Apply

Had some tough time while trying to understand this chapter. **Need to review
later.**

### How Decorators Can Add Properties to a Function

Say, we have a decorator like this:

```javascript
function decorator(func) {
  let wrapper = function(...args) {
    func.apply(this, args);
  };

  wrapper.aProperty = `This is a property of the passed function: ${func.name}.`;
  /* Magic happens in the previous line. */
  /* As we are returning `wrapper`, `aProperty` becomes a property of `func`, later accessible by `func.aProperty`.*/

  return wrapper;
}
```

### Arguments of a Function

Seems that when a function is called, it has an `arguments` property. I tried to
get an insight how this property works.

#### Test 1

```javascript
function testFunc() {
  console.log(arguments); // Prints: Arguments(4) [9, 3, 7, 0, callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]
  console.log(typeof arguments); // Prints: object
  for (let arg of arguments) {
    console.log(arg); // Prints: 9, 3, 7, 0 (each onn a new line)
  }
}

testFunc(9, 3, 7, 0);
```

Details of the first line looks like this:

``` 
Arguments(4) [9, 3, 7, 0, callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]
  0: 9
  1: 3
  2: 7
  3: 0
  callee: ƒ testFunc()
  length: 4
  Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ values()
  [[Prototype]]: Object
```

So now I know that `arguments` is an object, which is also iterable.

#### Test 2

Just tried to see, what `arguments` look like *after* the function's execution:

```javascript
console.log(testFunc.arguments); // And this prints `null`!
```

This means, `arguments` behave like `this`. It only has value when a function is
called—which is great.

#### Test 3

What if the function was *declared* to have an argument?

```javascript
function testFunc(arg1) {
  console.log(arg1); // Prints only 9
  for (let arg of arguments) {
    console.log(arg); // Prints: 9, 3, 7, 0 (each on a new line)
  }
}

testFunc(9, 3, 7, 0);
```

This means, no matter how the function is declared, `arguments` really have all
the arguments passed.

#### Test 4

And what if the function has rest parameters?

```javascript
function testFunc(arg1, ...args) {
  console.log(arg1); // Prints only 9
  for (let arg of args) {
    console.log(arg); // Prints only 3, 7, 0 (each on a new line)
  }
}

testFunc(9, 3, 7, 0);
```

This also perfectly makes sense.




## Function Binding

Lesson: https://javascript.info/bind

Felt this too hard, probably because I couldn't grasp the previous chapter
properly.

⚠️ <span style="color: orange">I wish to revisit this later.</span>




## Prototypal Inheritance

Problem: https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance#searching-algorithm

Funny. This problem asks to assign prototype that follows a path
`pockets → bed → table → head`. We have a property `glasses` in head, and
nowhere else.

The question is, which will be accessible faster—`heads.glasses` or
`pockets.glasses`?

The immediate answer feels like, of course, `heads.glasses`. But the witty
problem creator also asked to do some benchmarking. So I did it like this—

```javascript
function getCalculationTime(whatToCalculate, numberOfIterations) {
  let startTime = new Date();
  for (let i = 0; i < numberOfIterations; i++) {
    let temp = whatToCalculate;
  }
  let endTime = new Date();
  return endTime - startTime;
}

let timesInCSV = ``;

for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  let headTime = getCalculationTime(head.glasses, 10e7);
  let pocketTime = getCalculationTime(pockets.glasses, 10e7);
  timesInCSV += `${headTime}, ${pocketTime}\n`;
}

console.log(timesInCSV);
```

This produces some surprising results—

| Category | Time for `head.glasses` (ms) | Time for `pockets.glasses` (ms) |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Mean     | 91.412                       | 90.259                          |
| Median   | 86                           | 84                              |
| SD       | 27.14                        | 27.08                           |

My interpretation of this, **before reading** the answer, is like this—

1. When we implement a prototype, an object actually *gets* the inherited
   properties. So when looked for `anObject.inheritedProperty`, it does not need
   to look way up the chain.
2. My benchmarking process was specially bad. I think it started when no other
   CPU-heavy process was running in my PC. Then I started some Edge tabs for a
   bit of browsing—which occupied CPU, and that resulted in ugly-high standard
   deviations.

**Actual Answer:** This is also close to what I thought. Modern JS engines are
well optimized, and objects can 'remember' from where it got an inherited
property. So when requested for the second time, it has become optimized.
